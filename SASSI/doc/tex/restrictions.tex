\section{What can go in an instrumentation handler?}
\label{sec:what-can-go}

Not all CUDA is legal within SASSI instrumentation handlers.  For example,
thread barriers (\texttt{syncthreads}) cannot be used because the
instrumentation function may be called when the threads in a warp are
diverged; {\tt syncthreads} executed by diverged warps precludes all
threads from reaching the common barrier.  Finally, SASSI
instrumentation libraries that use shared resources, such as stack, shared
and constant memory, not only risk affecting occupancy, but they could
also cause instrumented programs to fail. For instance, it is not
uncommon for programs to use \emph{all} of shared memory, leaving
nothing for the instrumentation library. In practice, we have not been
limited by these restrictions.

We should also point out that designing instrumentation handlers for
SASSI requires the user to carefully consider synchronization and data
sharing. Writing parallel programs is tricky business, and SASSI
instrumentation code is highly parallel by design.
